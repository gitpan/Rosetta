The primary initial development of the Rosetta core (that which is in the
'Rosetta' distribution) is done.  While further improvements are planned, they
will be implemented over time as they are needed.  See the separately released
"Rosetta-Extensions" distribution for a clue as it is the initial main
dependent of the Rosetta core.
