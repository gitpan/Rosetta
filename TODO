* Add a /demos folder, starting with a trivial cmd-line genealogy app.

* Add support to Literal Interfaces and/or another new Interface type to

entirely in RAM at once.

* Keep watch on the separately released "Rosetta-Engine-Generic" and
"Rosetta-Emulator-DBI" and ensure we continue to meet their needs.
