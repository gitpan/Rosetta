TODO

* Update the white space of this distribution to follow some best practices.
This includes having code lines (and POD lines, presumably) not be longer than
80 or 78 characters.  Also run the works through perltidy for the first time as
well (though I was very consistent before), which may alter a few other things
towards best practices.

* Convert all class objects to be of the inside-out variety rather than
hash-based, so to gain rigorous protection against external code directly
accessing our object attributes, and to avoid related maintenance problems.

* Do some serious refactoring / design changing of Rosetta.pm.

* Add a /demos folder, starting with a trivial cmd-line genealogy app.

* Once the above are done, announce Rosetta/SQL::Routine Developer Release #3.

* Add support to Literal Interfaces and/or another new Interface type to
elegantly handle large scalar values (LOBs) so we don't try to hold them
entirely in RAM at once.

* Keep watch on the separately released "Rosetta-Engine-Generic" and
"Rosetta-Emulator-DBI" and ensure we continue to meet their needs.
