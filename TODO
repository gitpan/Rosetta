* Add a /demos folder, starting with a trivial cmd-line genealogy app.

* Perhaps split prepare() into compile() and prepare(); the first produces
anything that can be done after a Connection is defined but while it is not
open, such as *generating* Perl and SQL; the latter can only be done when the
connection is open, such as DBI->prepare() stuff.  Consider changing things so 
the current concept of a Preparation Interface goes away.

* Create a branch of this distribution that is written in Perl 6 but matches
this mainline distribution feature-wise.  This fork will initially have a
dependency in Autrijus Tang's "Pugs" distribution, which will be the runtime
engine that it runs under; later it will run under the "Parrot" engine.

* The primary initial development of the Rosetta core (that which is in the
'Rosetta' distribution) [was thought to be but in fact wasn't] done.  While
further improvements are planned, they will be implemented over time as they are
needed.  See the separately released "Rosetta-Extensions" distribution for a
clue as it is the initial main dependent of the Rosetta core.
