	* Rosetta Release 0.44.

	* New code file versions are: Rosetta.pm and Validator.pm v0.44.

	* Updated external dependencies on SQL::Routine to v0.59.

	* This release is entirely about maintaining compatability with
	SQL::Routine, whose Container objects now auto-destruct when all external
	refs to them go away, and holding an external ref to a Container's Node is
	no longer sufficient to prevent the auto-destruction; Containers no longer 
	have any manual destroy() methods.

	* Updated Rosetta.pm:  Added 1 new Interface property, 'srt_cont', which is
	defined to store a direct ref to the SRT Container object that 'srt_node'
	lives in.  This is necessary when external code expects an Interface tree to
	maintain the sole reference to the SRT Container it is using.  The 2
	Interface methods new() and get_srt_container() were updated accordingly.

	* Updated Rosetta.pm and Details.pod and Validator.pm:  Removed the
	Interface.destroy_interface_tree_and_srt_container() method declaration; any
	invocations of it now call destroy_interface_tree(), having the same effect.

	* A few trivial Framework.pod updates.

	* Renamed this file to 'Changes' from 'ChangeLog'; the new name is more
	descriptive to its free-form structure, and more consistent with CPAN (which
	uses both names but 'Changes' seems to be more common these days).  Also
	truncated this Changes file to remove all detail entries for releases v0.28
	thru v0.43; in their place was added a change summary for releases v0.01
	thru v0.43 that mainly just said what the names and versions of all the
	predecessor distributions and modules are.

	* Rosetta Release 0.07, containing Rosetta 0.062, was released on CPAN. 
	This is the first release for this distribution and Rosetta module where
	they both do not explicitly have matching version numbers.

2003-03-09   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Rosetta Release 0.061, containing Rosetta 0.061, was released on CPAN.

	both explicitly have matching version numbers, aside from the explicitly
	matched releases 0.33 and later.

2003-01-27   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Rosetta Release 0.02, containing Rosetta 0.02, was released on CPAN; this
	is the first release of the Rosetta distribution, which was renamed from
	DBIx-Portable.  This is the first release of any distribution to contain
	Rosetta, which at this time contains no executable code but for declaring a
	name and version.  Early versions of the design documentation that became
	the Rosetta distribution were included.

	The next version of the Module List will list the following module:

	  description: Framework for RDBMS-generic apps and schemas
	  userid:      DUNCAND (Darren Duncan)

	* DBIx-Portable Release 0.01, containing DBIx::Portable 0.01, was released
	on CPAN; this is the only release of the DBIx-Portable distribution, which
	was subsequently renamed to Rosetta.  This is the only release of any
	distribution to contain DBIx::Portable, which at this time contains no
	executable code but for declaring a name and version.  This is the first
	release of any distribution to contain design documentation that became the
	Rosetta distribution.

2002-11-12   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Began development on the modules which became the Rosetta
	distribution as their own entity that is separate from my application, for
	open-source distribution on CPAN.  The modules were to comprise an
	RDBMS-generic DB framework for any application to use.

	* Modules based on a template created by h2xs 1.18.

2002-07-28

	* Posted the first significant update to the second prototype, which added
	an index or cache for data that was expensive to calculate for each page
	request, and involved rewriting about a fourth of the perl code.

2002-06-07

	* Posted to my website the second public prototype demo of the new
	self-proprietary database driven application, whose database schema, user
	interface, feature set, and Perl application code was almost completely
	rewritten. The new version explicitly had separate modules for database
	communication and the web interface logic, with MySQL-specific code and
	database generic or data dictionary code in separate files, and separate
	files for parts of the web interface.  The program used the same generic
	CPAN modules as in the first prototype, DBI/MySQL and CGI::Portable.

2001-11-24

	* Posted the last update to the first prototype.

2001-07-12

	* Posted to my website the first public prototype demo of a new
	self-proprietary database driven application, which is like a cross between
	a multimedia metadata catalogue and a repository for historical or
	genealogical data.  This application contained the first prototypes of code
	that ended up in these modules.  All of this application's code, for
	database communication and web interface logic, was situated in a single
	module, with the rest of the program being more generic CPAN modules like
	DBI (and DBD for MySQL) and CGI::Portable.

2000-05-17

	* Requested MySQL database privileges on my web host so I have something to
	start developing, testing and deploying database driven applications on.
