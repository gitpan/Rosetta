    * Rosetta Release 0.48.2 (SVN r813).

    * New code file versions are: Rosetta.pm and Validator.pm 0.48.2.

    * Merged Details.pod into Rosetta.pm:  The Rosetta.pm main
    documentation section BRIEF FUNCTION AND METHOD LIST was deleted, and
    all of the significant content of Details.pod was placed in the same
    location.  These 23 main documentation sections were moved from
    Details.pod to Rosetta.pm: STRUCTURE, FEATURE SUPPORT VALIDATION,
    CONSTRUCTOR WRAPPER FUNCTIONS, INTERFACE OBJECT METHODS, INDIRECT
    APPLICATION OBJECT METHODS, plus [* CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTIONS, * OBJECT
    METHODS] where '*' is each of [APPLICATION, ENVIRONMENT, CONNECTION,
    CURSOR, LITERAL, SUCCESS, PREPARATION, ERROR], ENGINE OBJECT FUNCTIONS
    AND METHODS, DISPATCHER OBJECT FUNCTIONS AND METHODS.  These 5
    remaining Details.pod documentation sections were redundant and simply
    deleted with their now superfluous file: NAME, DESCRIPTION, SEE ALSO,
    AUTHOR, LICENSE AND COPYRIGHT.  Removed all references to Details.pod
    in all other distribution files.

    * Updated the BRIEF MODULE LIST of Framework.pod to remove the
    references to SQL::Routine::Details and Rosetta::Details, both of which
    no longer exist.

    * Updated Framework.pod to remove all references to possible versions
    of this library that are written in other languages, such as C or
    Parrot/Pugs/Perl 6.  A C version is unlikely to ever happen, or by that
    time these references would be severely out of date, and either way
    they are clutter now.  The Perl 6 version is happening now, but since
    that is a clone of the Perl 5 version, there's no point for its
    documentation to refer to itself as a potential future project. Removed
    the last STRUCTURE paragraph, which specified details about a C
    representation of Rosetta.  Removed the whole main documentation
    section AN ALTERNATIVE SECOND VERSION, which mentioned Parrot etc.

    * Rosetta Release 0.48.1 (SVN r808).

    * New code file versions are: Rosetta.pm and Validator.pm 0.48.1 and
    Rosetta/L/en.pm 0.19.1 and Validator/L/en.pm 0.14.1.

    * Updated the BRIEF MODULE LIST of Framework.pod to reflect that
    SQL::Routine, Rosetta::Engine::Generic gained a few inner classes
    recently.

    * Updated all POD-containing files to re-wrap any non-indented POD
    paragraphs to a 75 character width, which is 5 less than the 80
    character width they were wrapped to before.  This change should make
    it easier to copy and paste a diff or patch of this documentation into
    an email message, where it is quoted at least once, without any line
    wrapping occurring.  Likewise, these standard documentation files were
    re-wrapped to 75 characters: ReadMe, INSTALL, LGPL|GPL, Changes, TODO.

    * Revised this Changes file to replace all detail entries for releases
    0.44 thru 0.48.0 with a significant release list for the same period;
    also added references to when all 'Rosetta developer release' (#s 1-3)
    were.

2005-09-08   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.48.0 (SVN r787), containing Rosetta 0.48.0 and
    Rosetta::Validator 0.48.0, was released on CPAN.  This is the first
    release of this distribution and its modules for which they had 3-part
    version numbers, rather than floating point version numbers.

    * These were the current versions cited by the public announcement for
    Rosetta/SQL-Routine developer release #3.

2005-09-01   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.47, containing Rosetta 0.47 and Rosetta::Validator
    0.47, was released on CPAN.  This is the first release of
    Rosetta::Validator following its merger with
    Rosetta::Utility::EasyBake.  This is the last release of this
    distribution and its modules for which they had floating point version
    numbers, rather than 3-part version numbers.

2005-07-07   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.46, containing Rosetta 0.46 and Rosetta::Validator
    0.46 and Rosetta::Utility::EasyBake 0.01, was released on CPAN.  This
    is the first release of any distribution to contain
    Rosetta::Utility::EasyBake, which was split off from Rosetta; this is
    the first release of Rosetta following that split.  This is the last
    release of Rosetta::Utility::EasyBake prior to its merger into
    Rosetta::Validator.

2005-05-13   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.45, containing Rosetta 0.45 and Rosetta::Validator
    0.45, was released on CPAN.  This is the last release of Rosetta prior
    to its split into itself and Rosetta::Utility::EasyBake.

2005-04-03   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.43, containing Rosetta 0.43 and Rosetta::Validator
    0.43, was released on CPAN.

    * These were the current versions cited by the public announcement for
    SQL-Routine/Rosetta developer release #2.

2004-10-26   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.37, containing Rosetta 0.37 and Rosetta::Validator
    0.37, was released on CPAN.  This is the first release for this
    distribution where Rosetta and Rosetta::Validator explicitly have
    matching version numbers.

2004-10-04   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.36, containing Rosetta 0.36 and Rosetta::Validator
    0.06, was released on CPAN.  This is the last release for this
    distribution where Rosetta and Rosetta::Validator do not explicitly
    have matching version numbers.

2004-08-16   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.33, containing Rosetta 0.33 and Rosetta::Validator
    0.03, was released on CPAN.  This is the first release for this
    distribution and Rosetta module where they both explicitly have
    matching version numbers, aside from the explicitly matched releases
    0.01 thru 0.061.

    * Rosetta Release 0.07, containing Rosetta 0.062, was released on CPAN.
    This is the first release for this distribution and Rosetta module
    where they both do not explicitly have matching version numbers.

2003-03-09   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.061, containing Rosetta 0.061, was released on
    CPAN. This is the last release for this distribution and Rosetta module
    where they both explicitly have matching version numbers, aside from
    the explicitly matched releases 0.33 and later.

2003-01-27   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.02, containing Rosetta 0.02, was released on CPAN;
    this is the first release of the Rosetta distribution, which was
    renamed from DBIx-Portable.  This is the first release of any
    distribution to contain Rosetta, which at this time contains no
    executable code but for declaring a name and version.  Early versions
    of the design documentation that became the Rosetta distribution were
    included.

2003-01-21   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    The next version of the Module List will list the following module:

      modid:       Rosetta
      DSLIP:       cdpOp
      description: Framework for RDBMS-generic apps and schemas

    The resulting entry will be:

    Rosetta           cdpOp Framework for RDBMS-generic apps and schemas DUNCAND

2003-01-05   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * DBIx-Portable Release 0.01, containing DBIx::Portable 0.01, was
    released on CPAN; this is the only release of the DBIx-Portable
    distribution, which was subsequently renamed to Rosetta.  This is the
    only release of any distribution to contain DBIx::Portable, which at
    this time contains no executable code but for declaring a name and
    version.  This is the first release of any distribution to contain
    design documentation that became the Rosetta distribution.

2002-11-12   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Began development on the modules which became the Rosetta
    distribution as their own entity that is separate from my application,
    for open-source distribution on CPAN.  The modules were to comprise an
    RDBMS-generic DB framework for any application to use.

    * Modules based on a template created by h2xs 1.18.

2002-07-28

    * Posted the first significant update to the second prototype, which
    added an index or cache for data that was expensive to calculate for
    each page request, and involved rewriting about a fourth of the perl
    code.

2002-06-07

    * Posted to my website the second public prototype demo of the new
    self-proprietary database driven application, whose database schema,
    user interface, feature set, and Perl application code was almost
    completely rewritten. The new version explicitly had separate modules
    for database communication and the web interface logic, with
    MySQL-specific code and database generic or data dictionary code in
    separate files, and separate files for parts of the web interface.  The
    program used the same generic CPAN modules as in the first prototype,
    DBI/MySQL and CGI::Portable.

    * This is when I started writing self-contained code components that
    were explicitly designed to enable external code that used them to work
    seamlessly on multiple database products, and hence 2002 is the start
    of my declared copyright date range for Rosetta.

2001-11-24

    * Posted the last update to the first prototype.

2001-07-12

    * Posted to my website the first public prototype demo of a new
    self-proprietary database driven application, which is like a cross
    between a multimedia metadata catalogue and a repository for historical
    or genealogical data.  This application contained the first prototypes
    of code that ended up in these modules.  All of this application's
    code, for database communication and web interface logic, was situated
    in a single module, with the rest of the program being more generic
    CPAN modules like DBI (and DBD for MySQL) and CGI::Portable.

2000-05-17

    * Requested MySQL database privileges on my web host so I have
    something to start developing, testing and deploying database driven
    applications on.
