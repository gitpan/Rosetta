    * Rosetta Release 0.71.0 (SVN r1184).

    * This is a retroactive release, made on intended to help ease the
    transition between the first and second major code bases of the Rosetta
    database access framework.  (The first codebase was written mainly
    between 2002-12 and 2005-09, while the second rewritten code base was
    mainly between 2005-10 and later.)  While this release actually takes
    place on January "Friday The Thirteenth" 2006 and is affected by recent
    design decisions, it is for the most part as identical as possible to
    the most recent (2005-09-28) other release of the first code base.
    Think of this retroactive release as having been made on 2005-09-29, in
    regards to its dependency versions, design decisions, documentation for
    SVN repository location, TODO, etc.  Some of the details being
    published now, like the SVN location, is already false (its actually at
    http://svn.utsl.gen.nz/trunk/Rosetta-old/), but they are maintained as
    they were for historical posterity.

    * The changes with this release are all summed up by that there is no
    longer a distinct "SQL::Routine" name space, and all packages that were
    in that name space are now in the "Rosetta" name space.  There are no
    actual functionality changes, just a shifting around of components;
    your existing code that used the old packages will remain compatible
    with just some renaming of your package references.

    * For the first time since release 0.27 (2004-03-21), the entire inner
    core of the Rosetta framework is now in a single distribution; the
    "SQL-Routine" and "Rosetta" distributions have merged into "Rosetta";
    "Rosetta-0.71.0" is the next version after both "SQL-Routine-0.70.3"
    and "Rosetta-0.48.3".

    * No previously "Rosetta" packages have been renamed, but all of the
    previously "SQL-Routine" packages have been, as follows: SQL::Routine
    -> Rosetta::Model, SQL::Routine::L::en -> Rosetta::Model::L::en,
    SQL::Routine::Language -> Rosetta::Language, SQL::Routine::EnumTypes ->
    Rosetta::EnumTypes, SQL::Routine::NodeTypes -> Rosetta::NodeTypes.

    * All previously SQL-Routine t/* files have been renamed: t/SRT_*.t ->
    t/ROS_*.t, t/lib/t_SRT_*.t -> t/lib/t_ROS_*.t; the 2 t/ROS_00_Compile.t
    were then merged into one file.

    * All of these corresponding files from each distribution were merged:
    Changes, Makefile.PL, MANIFEST, META.yml, ReadMe, TODO, GPL, INSTALL;
    the last 2 were already identical, so no changes; the first 6 all saw
    changes from either of their originals, with Changes having the most.

    * All versioned files had their versions incremented to the next Y of
    X.Y.Z, regardless of any actual changes.  As exceptions to this,
    "Rosetta" and "Rosetta::Validator" were further incremented to match
    the incremented-once "Rosetta::Model", so that all 3 have now and
    forever identical versions, which are the same as the "Rosetta"
    distribution; currently all 4 are 0.71.0.  The other versioned files
    now have these versions: Rosetta::L::en is 0.20.0,
    Rosetta::Model::L::en is 0.39.0, Rosetta::Validator::L::en is 0.15.0.

    * Renamed all Locale::KeyedText Message and Template keys from "SRT_*"
    to "ROS_M_*".  Er, you may have to update your code to account for this
    also, to avoid breakage.

    * Updated 7 files to rename the data dictionary items
    "SRT_NODE[|_LIST]" to "ROS_M_NODE[|_LIST]".  Er, you may have to update
    your code to account for this also, to avoid breakage.

    * In Rosetta.pm, renamed the 'srt_cont' property of Rosetta::Interface
    to 'model_cont'.  Also renamed the get_srt_container() accessor method
    to get_model_container(), plus calls to same in Validator.pm.  Er, you
    may have to update your code to account for this also, to avoid
    breakage.

    * In EnumTypes.pod and Model.pm, renamed all 39 mentions of the
    'exception_type' enumerated type values from 'SRTX_*' to 'ROSMX_*'.

2006-01-07   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    Record update in the PAUSE modules database:

    mlstatus: [delete] was [list]

    The entry used to be:

    SQL::
    ::Routine         adpOg Specify all database tasks with SQL routines DUNCAND

2005-09-28   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * SQL-Routine Release 0.70.3 (SVN r878).

    * New code file versions are: Routine.pm 0.70.3 and en.pm 0.38.2.

    * From now on, any ordinary 'use [|only ]Foo' statements that appear
    within *.pm files will be located in different places than before; the
    'use' statements for modules that do not export anything, particularly
    object oriented modules, will appear near the top of the file, above
    all package declarations, but just below the use-pragma statements; the
    'use' statements for modules whose exported functions we are using will
    be placed just below the declarations of each package in which the
    relevant exported functions are used.

    * Removed any line-trailing whitespace from all distribution files.

    * Reformatted all code by swapping various string quoting delimiters.

    * Reformatted Routine.pm to un-cuddle all 'else' and 'elsif' blocks.

    * Updated the _set_primary_parent_attribute() method in Routine.pm to
    replace its postfix do-while loop with an equivalent code block
    featuring an ordinary 'while' loop.  Likewise, updated the
    _find_node_by_surrogate_id_remotely() method to replace its postfix
    do-until loop with an equivalent code block featuring an ordinary
    'while' loop.

    * Updated Routine.pm and t_SRT_Util.pm to replace all of their 'unless'
    conditionals with equivalent 'if' conditionals.

    * Updated Routine.pm to rename all of its 'foreach' loops to 'for'.

    * Updated Routine.pm to move its 2 for-loop labels upwards to their own
    lines.

    * Updated Routine.pm to reformat the 1 '|' delimited regular expression
    as a '/' delimited one.

    * Updated Routine.pm to reformat all 14 regular expressions so that
    they use the /x flag.

    * Reformatted all code to change any "if( ... ) {" to "if (...) {".

    * Updated Routine.pm to reformat all 8 'while' like the 'if' were.

    * Added named constants $EMPTY_STR and $INDENT to Routine.pm.

    * Updated Routine.pm to add labels to all un-labeled [next|last|redo]
    statements (22), and their innermost bounding loop controls (15).

    * Reformatted all code so that any uses of the named unary operators
    [defined|ref] no longer have parenthesis around their argument.

    * Updated Routine.pm to reformat 14 uses of 'delete', and 16 uses of
    'exists', and 7 uses of 'scalar', like with 'ref'.

    * Removed 20 superfluous uses of 'scalar' in Routine.pm.

    * Updated Routine.pm to replace 32 "<condition> and return ...;" each
    with "return ... if <condition>;".

    * Updated Routine.pm to replace 37 "<condition> or return ...;" each
    with "return ... if <complement-condition>;".

    * Updated Routine.pm to split up each of 11 "return if !(my $foo =
    ...);" statements into 2, "my $foo = ...;" and "return if !$foo;".

    * Updated Routine.pm to replace 17 "<condition> [and|or] [next|last]
    ...;" with "[next|last] ... if ..." like with 'return'.

    * Updated Routine.pm to replace every "<condition> [and|or]
    $self->_throw ..." each with "$self->_throw ... if
    [<condition>|<complement-condition>]".

    * Updated Routine.pm to replace 17 "if ... return ..." with their
    postfix-if equivalents; t_SRT_Util.pm also had 1 such change.

    * Updated Routine.pm and SRT_11_Circular.t to rearrange (3,2)
    conditional 'die' statements so they have postfix-if conditionals.

    * Updated Routine.pm to rearrange 28 conditional '_throw...' statements
    so they have postfix-if conditionals.

    * Reformatted all code, in Routine.pm, so that any uses of the built-in
    operators or functions named [bless|join|push|shift|splice|unshift] no
    longer have parenthesis around their argument lists; either the parens
    were just removed, or they were moved to surround both the
    operator/function name and its arguments.

    * Updated Routine.pm to reformat all 13 uses of the honorary built-in
    function Scalar::Util::weaken() so it looks like a built-in; for each
    use, the package-name qualifier was removed, as were the parenthesis
    around its lone argument.  Since Scalar::Util exports nothing by
    default, added a 'qw( weaken )' suffix to its 'use' statement.

    * Added new external dependency on the honorary built-in function
    List::Util::first() to Routine.pm.  Then rewrote 4 '(grep { $_ } @)[0]'
    expressions as 'first { $_ } @', in the _build_node_is_child_or_not()
    and valid_node_type_surrogate_id_attributes() functions.

    * Added new external dependency on the honorary built-in function
    List::MoreUtils::first_index() to Routine.pm.  Then rewrote the
    _clear_node_ref_attribute() method to use this function rather than a
    last-terminated for-loop when looking for a child Node in its parent's
    child list.  Specifically, List::MoreUtils versions 0.12 and up are
    required, since versions 0.11 and below didn't export some functions.

    * In Routine.pm, updated the _assert_in_node_deferrable_constraints()
    in several ways: 1. Added a new explicit test that a Node's "id" is
    set, which while redundant now, won't be after a future update; 2. The
    always-mandatory attribute validation test now reports a list of all
    failing attributes, rather than just the first one encountered; 3.
    Rewrote 3 other test blocks to be more concise, using grep statements
    rather than for-with-push loops.  Related to the #2 changes, updated
    en.pm to rename and reword the 'SRT_N_ASDC_MA_VAL_NO_SET' user text
    message to 'SRT_N_ASDC_MA_VALS_NO_SET'; note that the en.pm message for
    #1 was already in en.pm from when what will be was then so.

    * Split up some long lines in en.pm.

    * Updated any DEPENDENCIES documentation to reformat any indented
    sections as paragraphs, and show version ranges like 'only' takes them.

    * Reformatted all code so that every occurance of the string
    concatenation operator (.) has a space between the operator and each of
    its 2 arguments, rather than their all being in contact.  Also
    reformatted any lines that are split on this operator so the operator
    appears at the start of the second line, rather than the end of the
    first line.

    * Reformatted a few multi-line statements so that any [=|and|or] that
    are split on appear at the start of a line rather than the end of one.

    * Reformatted all of the code comments at the top of Routine.pm,
    where its object property names, and constant values, are declared,
    so that all comment lines don't exceed the 75 character line length.

    * In Routine.pm, reformatted 4 cascading ternary statements into
    aligned columns.

    * Other miscellaneous code line alignments and splitting.

2005-09-28   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.48.3 (SVN r878).

    * New code file versions are: Rosetta.pm and Validator.pm 0.48.3 and
    Rosetta/L/en.pm 0.19.2 and Validator/L/en.pm 0.14.2.

    * From now on, any ordinary 'use [|only ]Foo' statements that appear
    within *.pm files will be located in different places than before; the
    'use' statements for modules that do not export anything, particularly
    object oriented modules, will appear near the top of the file, above
    all package declarations, but just below the use-pragma statements; the
    'use' statements for modules whose exported functions we are using will
    be placed just below the declarations of each package in which the
    relevant exported functions are used.

    * Removed any line-trailing whitespace from all distribution files.

    * Reformatted all code by swapping various string quoting delimiters.

    * Reformatted Rosetta.pm and Validator.pm to un-cuddle all 'else' and
    'elsif' blocks.

    * Updated Rosetta.pm and Validator.pm and Framework.pod to replace all
    of their 'unless' conditionals with equivalent 'if' conditionals.

    * Updated Rosetta.pm and Validator.pm and Framework.pod to rename all
    of their 'foreach' loops to 'for'.

    * Updated Rosetta.pm and Validator.pm to move their collective 5 switch
    statement labels upwards to their own lines.

    * Updated Framework.pod to reformat all 3 regular expressions so that
    they use the /x flag.

    * Reformatted all code to change any "if( ... ) {" to "if (...) {".

    * Updated Validator.pm to reformat all 4 'while' like the 'if' were.

    * Added named constant $EMPTY_STR to Rosetta.pm and Validator.pm.

    * In Framework.pod, removed redundant leading '&' from sub invocations.

    * Updated Rosetta.pm, Validator.pm, Framework.pod to add labels to all
    un-labeled [next|last|redo] statements (3,1,2), and their innermost
    bounding loop controls (2,1,2).

    * Reformatted all code so that any uses of the named unary operators
    [defined|ref] no longer have parenthesis around their argument.

    * Updated Rosetta.pm to reformat 2 uses of 'delete' like with 'ref';
    likewise updated Framework.pod with 2 uses of 'hex'.

    * Removed 1 superfluous use of 'scalar' in each of Validator.pm and
    Framework.pod.

    * In Validator.pm, split up 7 multi-statement lines so each statement
    is on its own line.

    * Updated Rosetta.pm to replace 5 "<condition> and return ...;" each
    with "return ... if <condition>;".

    * Updated Rosetta.pm to replace 3 "<condition> or return ...;" each
    with "return ... if <complement-condition>;".  Likewise replaced 4 in
    Validator.pm and 1 in Framework.pod.

    * Updated Rosetta.pm and Validator.pm to replace (2,8) "<condition>
    [and|or] [next|last] ...;" with "[next|last] ... if ..." like with
    'return'.

    * Updated Framework.pod to replace 10 "if ... return ..." with their
    postfix-if equivalents; Validator.pm also had 1 such change.

    * Updated Validator.pm to rearrange 8 conditional 'die' statements so
    they have postfix-if conditionals.

    * Updated Rosetta.pm to rearrange 29 conditional '_throw...' statements
    so they have postfix-if conditionals.

    * Reformatted all code, in Rosetta.pm and Validator.pm and
    Framework.pod, so that any uses of the built-in operators or functions
    named [bless|chomp|join|pack|push|read|shift|split] no longer have
    parenthesis around their argument lists; either the parens were just
    removed, or they were moved to surround both the operator/function name
    and its arguments.

    * Updated Rosetta.pm to reformat all 3 uses of the honorary built-in
    function Scalar::Util::weaken() so it looks like a built-in; for each
    use, the package-name qualifier was removed, as were the parenthesis
    around its lone argument.  Since Scalar::Util exports nothing by
    default, added a 'qw( weaken )' suffix to its 'use' statement.

    * Added new external dependency on the honorary built-in function
    List::Util::first() to Rosetta.pm.  Then replaced a last-terminated
    for-loop in _prepare__call_engine() with an invocation of it.

    * Added new external dependency on the honorary built-in function
    Scalar::Util::openhandle() to both the set_trace_fh() method of
    Rosetta.pm and the main() function of Validator.pm; both of these can
    now reliably test if their [NEW|TRACE]_FH argument is a valid open file
    handle, and they will now throw an exception if not.  Correspondingly,
    added 'ROS_CLASS_METH_ARG_NO_FH' user text message to Rosetta/L/en.pm,
    and 'ROS_VAL_V_MAIN_ARG_TRACE_NO_FH' to Validator/L/en.pm.  Also
    updated the setup_[env|conn]() methods of Validator.pm to only
    conditionally invoke set_trace_fh(), since passing it undef now results
    in an exception toss by the latter.

    * Split up some long lines in both en.pm.

    * Updated any DEPENDENCIES documentation to reformat any indented
    sections as paragraphs, and show version ranges like 'only' takes them.

    * Reformatted all code so that every occurance of the string
    concatenation operator (.) has a space between the operator and each of
    its 2 arguments, rather than their all being in contact.  Also
    reformatted any lines that are split on this operator so the operator
    appears at the start of the second line, rather than the end of the
    first line.

    * Reformatted a few multi-line statements so that any [=|and|or] that
    are split on appear at the start of a line rather than the end of one.

    * Reformatted all of the code comments at the top of Rosetta.pm and
    Validator.pm, where its object property names, and constant values, are
    declared, so that all comment lines don't exceed the 75 character line
    length.

    * In Framework.pod, reformatted 1 cascading ternary statement into
    aligned columns.

    * Other miscellaneous code line alignments and splitting.

2005-09-14   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * SQL-Routine Release 0.70.2 (SVN r813).

    * New code file versions are: Routine.pm 0.70.2.

    * Merged Details.pod into Routine.pm:  The Routine.pm main
    documentation section BRIEF FUNCTION AND METHOD LIST was deleted, and
    all of the significant content of Details.pod was placed in the same
    location.  These 17 main documentation sections were moved from
    Details.pod to Routine.pm: MATTERS OF PORTABILITY AND FEATURES,
    STRUCTURE, RELATING INTERFACE AND STORAGE CLASSES, ABOUT NODE GROUPS,
    "FAULT TOLERANCE, DATA INTEGRITY, AND CONCURRENCY", NODE IDENTITY
    ATTRIBUTES, CONSTRUCTOR WRAPPER FUNCTIONS, CONTAINER CONSTRUCTOR
    FUNCTIONS, CONTAINER OBJECT METHODS, NODE CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTIONS, NODE
    OBJECT METHODS, GROUP CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTIONS, GROUP OBJECT METHODS,
    CONTAINER OR NODE METHODS FOR DEBUGGING, CONTAINER OR NODE FUNCTIONS
    AND METHODS FOR RAPID DEVELOPMENT, INFORMATION FUNCTIONS, OLDER
    DOCUMENTATION.  These 5 remaining Details.pod documentation sections
    were redundant and simply deleted with their now superfluous file:
    NAME, DESCRIPTION, SEE ALSO, AUTHOR, LICENSE AND COPYRIGHT.  Removed
    all references to Details.pod in all other distribution files.

    * Updated Routine.pm and Language.pod to remove all references to
    possible versions of this library that are written in other languages,
    such as C or Parrot/Pugs/Perl 6.  A C version is unlikely to ever
    happen, or by that time these references would be severely out of date,
    and either way they are clutter now.  The Perl 6 version is happening
    now, but since that is a clone of the Perl 5 version, there's no point
    for its documentation to refer to itself as a potential future project.
    In Routine.pm, removed all the code comments for NodeStorage property
    declarations that specify how they would be represented in a C version
    of SQL::Routine.  In Routine.pm, removed the whole main documentation
    section OLDER DOCUMENTATION, whose sole content was details about C
    implementation, and mentions of Perl 6 etc.  In Language.pod, updated
    the NODE ATTRIBUTE TYPES intro paragraph to remove the mention of C
    versions, as well as the mention of there being separate accessor
    methods for each attribute type (not true since r0.68).

2005-09-14   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.48.2 (SVN r813).

    * New code file versions are: Rosetta.pm and Validator.pm 0.48.2.

    * Merged Details.pod into Rosetta.pm:  The Rosetta.pm main
    documentation section BRIEF FUNCTION AND METHOD LIST was deleted, and
    all of the significant content of Details.pod was placed in the same
    location.  These 23 main documentation sections were moved from
    Details.pod to Rosetta.pm: STRUCTURE, FEATURE SUPPORT VALIDATION,
    CONSTRUCTOR WRAPPER FUNCTIONS, INTERFACE OBJECT METHODS, INDIRECT
    APPLICATION OBJECT METHODS, plus [* CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTIONS, * OBJECT
    METHODS] where '*' is each of [APPLICATION, ENVIRONMENT, CONNECTION,
    CURSOR, LITERAL, SUCCESS, PREPARATION, ERROR], ENGINE OBJECT FUNCTIONS
    AND METHODS, DISPATCHER OBJECT FUNCTIONS AND METHODS.  These 5
    remaining Details.pod documentation sections were redundant and simply
    deleted with their now superfluous file: NAME, DESCRIPTION, SEE ALSO,
    AUTHOR, LICENSE AND COPYRIGHT.  Removed all references to Details.pod
    in all other distribution files.

    * Updated the BRIEF MODULE LIST of Framework.pod to remove the
    references to SQL::Routine::Details and Rosetta::Details, both of which
    no longer exist.

    * Updated Framework.pod to remove all references to possible versions
    of this library that are written in other languages, such as C or
    Parrot/Pugs/Perl 6.  A C version is unlikely to ever happen, or by that
    time these references would be severely out of date, and either way
    they are clutter now.  The Perl 6 version is happening now, but since
    that is a clone of the Perl 5 version, there's no point for its
    documentation to refer to itself as a potential future project. Removed
    the last STRUCTURE paragraph, which specified details about a C
    representation of Rosetta.  Removed the whole main documentation
    section AN ALTERNATIVE SECOND VERSION, which mentioned Parrot etc.

2005-09-12   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * SQL-Routine Release 0.70.1 (SVN r808).

    * New code file versions are: Routine.pm 0.70.1 and en.pm 0.38.1.

    * Updated all POD-containing files to re-wrap any non-indented POD
    paragraphs to a 75 character width, which is 5 less than the 80
    character width they were wrapped to before.  This change should make
    it easier to copy and paste a diff or patch of this documentation into
    an email message, where it is quoted at least once, without any line
    wrapping occurring.  Likewise, these standard documentation files were
    re-wrapped to 75 characters: ReadMe, INSTALL, LGPL|GPL, Changes, TODO.

    * Revised this Changes file to replace all detail entries for releases
    0.59 thru 0.70.0 with a significant release list for the same period;
    also added references to when all 'Rosetta developer release' (#s 1-3)
    were.

2005-09-12   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.48.1 (SVN r808).

    * New code file versions are: Rosetta.pm and Validator.pm 0.48.1 and
    Rosetta/L/en.pm 0.19.1 and Validator/L/en.pm 0.14.1.

    * Updated the BRIEF MODULE LIST of Framework.pod to reflect that
    SQL::Routine, Rosetta::Engine::Generic gained a few inner classes
    recently.

    * Updated all POD-containing files to re-wrap any non-indented POD
    paragraphs to a 75 character width, which is 5 less than the 80
    character width they were wrapped to before.  This change should make
    it easier to copy and paste a diff or patch of this documentation into
    an email message, where it is quoted at least once, without any line
    wrapping occurring.  Likewise, these standard documentation files were
    re-wrapped to 75 characters: ReadMe, INSTALL, LGPL|GPL, Changes, TODO.

    * Revised this Changes file to replace all detail entries for releases
    0.44 thru 0.48.0 with a significant release list for the same period;
    also added references to when all 'Rosetta developer release' (#s 1-3)
    were.

2005-09-08   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * SQL-Routine Release 0.70.0 (SVN r787), containing SQL::Routine
    0.70.0, was released on CPAN.  This is the first release of this
    distribution and its modules for which they had 3-part version numbers,
    rather than floating point version numbers.

    * Rosetta Release 0.48.0 (SVN r787), containing Rosetta 0.48.0 and
    Rosetta::Validator 0.48.0, was released on CPAN.  This is the first
    release of this distribution and its modules for which they had 3-part
    version numbers, rather than floating point version numbers.

    * These were the current versions cited by the public announcement for
    Rosetta/SQL-Routine developer release #3.

2005-09-01   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * SQL-Routine Release 0.69, containing SQL::Routine 0.69, was released
    on CPAN.  This is the last release of this distribution and its modules
    for which they had floating point version numbers, rather than 3-part
    version numbers.

    * Rosetta Release 0.47, containing Rosetta 0.47 and Rosetta::Validator
    0.47, was released on CPAN.  This is the first release of
    Rosetta::Validator following its merger with
    Rosetta::Utility::EasyBake.  This is the last release of this
    distribution and its modules for which they had floating point version
    numbers, rather than 3-part version numbers.

2005-07-07   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.46, containing Rosetta 0.46 and Rosetta::Validator
    0.46 and Rosetta::Utility::EasyBake 0.01, was released on CPAN.  This
    is the first release of any distribution to contain
    Rosetta::Utility::EasyBake, which was split off from Rosetta; this is
    the first release of Rosetta following that split.  This is the last
    release of Rosetta::Utility::EasyBake prior to its merger into
    Rosetta::Validator.

2005-05-13   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.45, containing Rosetta 0.45 and Rosetta::Validator
    0.45, was released on CPAN.  This is the last release of Rosetta prior
    to its split into itself and Rosetta::Utility::EasyBake.

    distribution, which was subsequently renamed to Rosetta.  This is the
    only release of any distribution to contain DBIx::Portable, which at
    this time contains no executable code but for declaring a name and
    version.  This is the first release of any distribution to contain
    design documentation that became the Rosetta distribution.

2002-11-12   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Began development on the modules which became the Rosetta
    distribution as their own entity that is separate from my application,
    for open-source distribution on CPAN.  The modules were to comprise an
    RDBMS-generic DB framework for any application to use.

    * Modules based on a template created by h2xs 1.18.

2002-07-28

    * Posted the first significant update to the second prototype, which
    added an index or cache for data that was expensive to calculate for
    each page request, and involved rewriting about a fourth of the perl
    code.

2002-06-07

    * Posted to my website the second public prototype demo of the new
    self-proprietary database driven application, whose database schema,
    user interface, feature set, and Perl application code was almost
    completely rewritten. The new version explicitly had separate modules
    for database communication and the web interface logic, with
    MySQL-specific code and database generic or data dictionary code in
    separate files, and separate files for parts of the web interface.  The
    program used the same generic CPAN modules as in the first prototype,
    DBI/MySQL and CGI::Portable.

    * This is when I started writing self-contained code components that
    were explicitly designed to enable external code that used them to work
    seamlessly on multiple database products, and hence 2002 is the start
    of my declared copyright date range for Rosetta.

2001-11-24

    * Posted the last update to the first prototype.

2001-07-12

    * Posted to my website the first public prototype demo of a new
    self-proprietary database driven application, which is like a cross
    between a multimedia metadata catalogue and a repository for historical
    or genealogical data.  This application contained the first prototypes
    of code that ended up in these modules.  All of this application's
    code, for database communication and web interface logic, was situated
    in a single module, with the rest of the program being more generic
    CPAN modules like DBI (and DBD for MySQL) and CGI::Portable.

2000-05-17

    * Requested MySQL database privileges on my web host so I have
    something to start developing, testing and deploying database driven
    applications on.
